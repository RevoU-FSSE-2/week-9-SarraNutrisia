## Syntax for Creating Database Table (MySQL)

MySQL is a well-known, free and open-source database application. Its high performance, ease of use and data security makes it a popular database solution. One of the most crucial processes in MySQL is creating tables to store and organize data. These are steps to creating database table in MySQL :

1. Install XAMPP into your computer and then start running MySQL App.

## Succesfully Connecting the Database to Node.js Locally

1. The first step is to install MySQL and the MySQL module for Node.js. You can install MySQL using your package manager or download it from the official website. Once MySQL is installed, you can install the MySQL module for Node.js using the following command: " npm install mysql2 ".
2. Before connecting Node.js with MySQL, you need to create a MySQL database and table to store data.
3. To connect Node.js with MySQL, you need to create a connection object using the mysql module. The connection object contains the necessary information to connect to the MySQL database.
